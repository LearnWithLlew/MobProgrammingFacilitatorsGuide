# Mob Programming Facilitors Guide
By [@LlewellynFalco](https://twitter.com/llewellynfalco)


This is a short guide to facilitating your 1st Mob Programming session with your team. 

## Picking the problem  
You should start with an easy problem. The goal should be to do something simple and have fun learning to mob. 
It could be part of work, or it could be a sample exercise. 
If you want a sample exercise, FizzBuzz is a rather good starting point.

Either way, you want to have the Coding Computer setup before you start the mob. 
Installing and setup is not very fun.

* [ ] I have a easy problem selected and a computer ready to go.

**Test** : Ask your developers if they can solve this problem alone in under an hour.

## Picking a time

A good starting time is between 90-120 minutes. Try not to do this durning lunch if possible.
Also, Don't overrun by missing lunch or staying late. 

``` The primary goal is to have fun and have people want to Mob again tomorrow.```

* [ ] I have a time on everyones calendar

  
## Setting up the Space

![Mob Programming Setup](images/MobProgrammingSetup.png)

The default configuration of most rooms is not suitable for mobbing. 
As a facilitator it is your job to rearrange the room to the best of your ability.
Tips:
 * Try to remove any distractions
 * Make it easy to move around the space
 * Have everyone facing the same direction, ideally looking at the same screen.
 * Bring a external mouse (external keyboard is a plus)
 * Have a whiteboard or simular place they can write.
 * While darkmode is great for solo programming, White backgrounds are easier to see on a projector.
 
 
 * [ ] The space is setup
   * [ ] The Font is big enough that everyone can read it from everywhere
   * [ ] The screen is easy to see
   * [ ] It is easy to move around
   * [ ] I have set a timer to leave space for the retrospective at the end (30 minutes for the 1st, 10-15 thereafter)
 
## 1st Rotation

The 1st rotation is where the most things can go wrong. 
You will want to lead this one stronger than the rest. 
As soon as possible, though, loosen up and let the mob take over.

### State the Rules

#### Working agreements

 * Kindness
 * Consideration
 * & Respect
 
 
 It is worth writing these down so everyone can see and refer back to them during the mob.
 
 * No phones or laptops during the mob
 * yes, and...
 
 The `yes, and...` rule refers to building on whatever came before you. It means you can't delete and startover when it is your turn. 
  
#### The Driver

``` No thinking at the keyboard ```

The person at the keyboard is called `The Driver`. They are only typing. It is ok for them to ask question, but no decisions should be made by them.

* [ ] The driver listen and following the navigator

Tip: If they aren't, just repeat the `No Thinking at the keyboard` rule outload.

#### The Navigator
 ```
  Speak in this order
  Intention    "Please create a variable called count"
  Location     "Line 27 and a half (a new line between #27 & #28)"
  Details      "Type v,a,r space count equals 1"
 ```
This is where all the thinking should occur. 
Make sure to make space for the navigator to try to talk, 
it takes some practice to get right.

The intention of the navigator should be clear. 
This often means writing an example on the white board,
an english comment in the code, or a check list in notepad

Allow check that the navigator is doing something that is moving us toward action.
If they are stuck prod them with questions. If they are discussing, force a **small**  decision.

#### The Mob

In The beginning the rest of the mob is going to practice listening while being quiet. This is quite hard and will take some practice. If the navigator is stuck, they can ask the mob, but they must repeat anything they want to happen to the driver:

Example:  
*Navigator*:  What should we do?  
*Mobber 1*: I think we should try debugging.  
*Mobber 2*: Yes I agree  
*Navigator*: Driver, can you start the debugger.   


* [ ] Your phone has a 2-4 minute timer with a sound when done.
* [ ] The Team has made some (small) progress
* [ ] Everyone is talking and listening

Tips: If you have 2 people that are scared or new to the domain seperate them so they aren't the driver/navigator pair.


## Rotations

Congratulations, you have gotten everyone to the keyboard at least once, now we can start the working on improving the flow.

At this point you should endeavor to talk only in questions. 
Keep an idea out for 

* Small victories to celebrate
* People not listening
* Not rotating / slow rotations
* Confusion in the new navigator
* New ways of using the tooling
* Long periods between running or checking in  the code
* Misunderstandings 

As facilitator you are here to help us learn and enjoy. If people are confused slow them down and make space to regain understanding. If someone in the group has that, make space for them to teach the rest of us. If we are stuck call it out and get us moving again. If we are not treating each other well, call that out as well.


## Common Problems

### Vocabulary
 Person doesn't know how to describe something on the screen. Maybe really wants to grab the keyboard/mouse   
 Phrase: `use your words`  
 Exercise: [Strong Style Vocab](http://github.com/learnwithllew)

### I don't know what to do...
 Person isn't sure what to do, and won't try anything.  
 Action: Pick something, anything  
 Phrase: `Failure helps us learn what success looks like`
 Tips:  
  * Try smaller numbers. Don't try 4 if you haven't yet tried 1
  * Guess. `3 should give llama right?`
  * Multiple Ideas? try all of them then vote.
  
### Let me discuss
 An other form of inaction is talking about the possible solutions.
 Make the navigator move, then they can explain why later (if people are still confused). Don't let this turn into a meeting.
 
 There are 2 reason I commonly see for this

That idea sucks
